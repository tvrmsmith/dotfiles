All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Replace `op whoami` with `op account get` as primary auth health check
- `op whoami` is broken in system-auth mode (1Password desktop app integration, op v2.30+): returns "not signed in" even when the desktop app is unlocked and all other `op` commands work
- Root cause: `op whoami` checks `config.latest_signin` (empty in system-auth mode) while all other commands use `system_auth_latest_signin` via the daemon socket
- `op whoami` retained as fallback note for CLI-only users who use `op signin` manually

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Aider install path: `.aider/CONVENTIONS.md` → `./CONVENTIONS.md` (Aider reads from project root)
- `op whoami --account` does not switch accounts; corrected to `eval $(op signin --account ...)`
- Bubblewrap sandbox workaround: replaced incorrect advice with real fix (`usermod -aG`)
- `convert.sh` `get_description()`: correctly handles multiline YAML block scalars
- `convert.sh` Cursor output: escape double quotes in YAML description field
- Shell environment persistence warnings added to `export TOKEN=` and `OP_USER`/`PASS` examples
- Case-sensitivity note added to `op://` URI format documentation
- macOS path added to `IdentityAgent` SSH config example
- Flatpak/Snap path note added for `op-ssh-sign` git signing binary
- SSH health check expected output documented
- README: clone step added to non-Claude install sections (Gemini CLI, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf)
- README: valid `--tool` values listed for `convert.sh`

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format)
- `plugin.json`: `author` and `repository` metadata fields
- `.gitignore`: `.idea/` and `.vscode/` exclusions

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Initial public release of the 1password-skill Claude Code plugin
- Core skill document (`skills/1password/SKILL.md`) with decision-router pattern for `op` CLI usage
- Six security rules enforcing `op run` over `op read`, vault scoping, no secrets in files, and minimal credential exposure
- Error catalog covering common `op` failures, auth recovery flow, and SSH agent troubleshooting
- Shell support matrix: bash/zsh and Fish variants for all code examples
- Multi-model integration support via `scripts/convert.sh`:
  - Gemini CLI (`integrations/gemini-cli/`)
  - Cursor (`.cursor/rules/1password.mdc`)
  - Aider (`integrations/aider/CONVENTIONS.md`)
  - Windsurf (`integrations/windsurf/.windsurfrules`)
- `convert.sh` with `--tool` flag for targeted generation and dynamic description extraction from SKILL.md frontmatter
- Gemini-powered tabula rasa review script (`scripts/gemini-review.sh`) for skill quality validation
- Comprehensive test suite (110 tests) covering convert.sh and plugin structure
- Apache 2.0 license

### Fixed
- Hardened test suite against `|| true` exit code traps and narrow regex patterns (adversarial review)
- Vault name sanitization in `gemini-review.sh`
- Dynamic Cursor description extraction from multiline YAML block scalars; corrected Gemini CLI install path in README
