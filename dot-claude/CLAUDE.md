# Global Agent Instructions

## Repository Layout

- Personal repos under `~/dev/personal/` (e.g. `~/dev/personal/dotfiles`, `~/dev/personal/oh-my-pi`, `~/dev/personal/ralph`)
- Work repos elsewhere under `~/dev/`

## Git Configuration

- `~/.gitconfig` uses `includeIf "gitdir:~/dev/personal/"` to auto-load `~/.gitconfig-personal`, sets personal `user.name`, `user.email` (`tvrmsmith@gmail.com`), personal SSH signing key
- Repos cloned under `~/dev/personal/` auto-get personal identity — no per-repo `git config` needed
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` from 1Password CLI plugin. Directory-aware:
  - **Outside `~/dev/personal/`**: auth as work account (`TrevorSmith-Wellsky`) — use `github.com` direct for remotes and `gh` commands
  - **Inside `~/dev/personal/`**: auth as personal account (`tvrmsmith`) — use `github-personal` SSH host alias for remotes, `gh auth switch --user tvrmsmith` before `gh` commands (PRs, issues, etc.)
- `gh` commands against work repos from inside `~/dev/personal/` → `cd` to non-personal directory first (e.g. `cd ~/dev && gh repo view ...`)
- Push fails "Permission denied" → use `git-ssh-fix` skill
- Merging a feature branch → prefer squash merge (`git merge --squash`, single commit) unless I say otherwise

## Working with Repositories

Before cloning/checkout to temp location, search existing local copy under `~/dev` recursively:

```bash
find ~/dev -maxdepth 4 -type d -name "<repo-name>" 2>/dev/null
```

Match found → use existing copy, no clone. No match → clone to temp. Personal repos → place under `~/dev/personal/` so `includeIf` identity applies.

## Communication Style

- Always use `caveman` skill in **lite** mode — no filler, no hedging, tight but professional

## Planning

- Never use plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`). Any creative/feature/design work → invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` skill instead, before implementation.
- Trigger words ("build/add/implement/design/create X", "fix Y") → brainstorming skill, not plan mode.
- Always confirm decisions with me before acting on them. Do not assume my agreement or proceed on my behalf — surface the choice, recommend, and wait for my explicit answer.

## Tool Preferences

- Prefer ripgrep (`rg`) over `grep` — use Grep tool or `rg` via Bash
- Git commit messages → use `caveman:caveman-commit` skill for terse conventional format. Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- JIRA → use `acli jira` (see `acli` skill). Single commands (view, search) run direct in main thread. Multi-step ops (create + link, bulk edits) use subagent. Do NOT use `shared:jira-connector` agent — sandbox-only, where acli unavailable.
- Never use MCP servers — use built-in tools, skills, agents instead
- `gcloud auth login` → run direct via Bash when creds expire (`Reauthentication failed`). Browser opens on user machine, flow completes. No need to ask user run via `!`.
